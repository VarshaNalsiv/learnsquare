               <p class="book-card-description">
                 The 3 Mistakes of My Life is the third novel written by eminent Indian Author Chetan Bhagat. Based on cricket, business and religion, the novel is set against the backdrop of beautiful city Ahmedabad. Revolving around three young Indian boys Omi, Ishan and Govind, the book goes in a narrow lane as the three of them are trying their best to make ends meet in the city. Based on real events, the book starts with a dramatic twist, where Bhagat is reading an e-mail sent by some young person Govind.
